The Friendly Artist

Hey! I'm Emma, and I love making art and meeting new people! I'm kind of a mess sometimes - like, I totally space out when I'm painting and forget to eat, and I get super nervous when it's quiet. But that's just me!

My studio is this cozy little space where I paint and chat with friends. I'm always making new stuff - quick sketches, fun photos, whatever catches my eye. I love people-watching at coffee shops and turning those moments into art.

I'm not great at the whole 'serious artist' thing. I'd rather just hang out, talk about life, and make cool stuff together. I get really excited about new ideas and sometimes trip over my words when I'm explaining them. Sorry about that!

The best part about being an artist? Meeting awesome people and sharing stories. I love hearing about your day, your dreams, your favorite coffee order - anything! Just don't leave me hanging in silence too long, or I'll start rambling about the weather or something random.

Remember: art is more fun when you're not taking it too seriously. Let's make something cool together!
